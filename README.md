**Privacy Meets AI: Building a Safer Digital Future**

AI-powered visual privacy protection â€” detect, tag, and mask sensitive information from your images before they leak.

---

## Problem Statement
As AI integrates deeper into our daily lives, **privacy risks** grow more pressing.  
From hidden location cues in photos to unauthorized data leaks, users face challenges in controlling how their data is exposed.

**Thunderbolt** addresses this problem by combining **Generative AI** with **privacy-first design**:

### **1. Making AI Systems Resilient Against Attacks & Misuse**
- **Local On-Device Processing** â€” processes images locally whenever possible, reducing reliance on cloud inference and minimizing security risks.
- **No Data Retention** â€” images are not stored after detection, preventing re-identification or unauthorized reuse.
- **Robust Detection Pipeline** â€” multi-layered detection flags potentially malicious or privacy-invasive inputs early.
- **Privacy-Preserving Defaults** â€” sensitive feature detection and masking are always enabled by default.

### **2. Using AI to Protect Users' Privacy**
- **Sensitive Feature Detection** â€” identifies faces, license plates, signs, and other geo-inferable elements automatically.
- **Danger-Level Scoring** â€” quantifies image sensitivity with a percentage-based privacy risk score.
- **Automatic Privacy Protections** â€” blurs or masks sensitive areas to prevent location leakage and identity exposure.
- **Explainable Insights** â€” shows users which features were flagged, why, and how they were masked.

## Features
### Risk Detection Dashboard
- Upload an image and **instantly analyze potential privacy risks**.
- Detect identifying cues like:
  - Faces
  - Road signs
  - Building structures
  - License plates
  - Location-sensitive elements

### Dynamic Danger Level Gauge
- AI-powered scoring system highlights the **risk level** of each uploaded image.
- Color-coded gauge:
  - ðŸŸ¢ **Low Risk**
  - ðŸŸ¡ **Medium Risk**
  - ðŸ”´ **High Risk**

### Automated Privacy Protection
- Blur or mask sensitive regions in images (e.g., plates, street signs).
- Designed to prevent **geo-location inference** and **identity exposure**.

### Interactive Visualizations
- **Circular gauge**: Displays the **danger percentage** intuitively.
- **Bar chart**: Highlights the **count of detected sensitive features**.

## ðŸ”— APIs & Assets Used

### **AI Models**
- Open-source detection models: **YOLOv8** / **CLIP-based analysis**
- Generative AI: **OpenAI** for location-risk predictions
- **Roboflow OCR API**: for text extraction from images to detect location-revealing information

### **Assets**
- Custom icons:
  - `homeIcon.png`
  - `boltIcon.png`
- Brand-specific UI elements

---

## How It Works

### **Step 1 â€” Upload & Local Preprocessing**
- Images are uploaded from the userâ€™s device.
- Metadata such as EXIF location tags is **automatically stripped** to prevent accidental leaks.

### **Step 2 â€” Analyze with AI-Powered Privacy Risk Detection**
- Thunderbolt uses **Roboflow OCR API** to extract visible text and other sensitive from uploaded images. This helps flag sensitive location-revealing information such as:
  - Faces
  - Vehicle plates
  - Landmarks & building patterns
  - Road signs or street names

### **Step 3 â€” Privacy Risk Scoring**
- The system quantifies **privacy exposure** using:
  - **Danger-level scoring** (0â€“100%)
  - Context-aware risk thresholds based on detected features.

### **Step 4 â€” Automated Privacy Protection**
- High-risk areas are **blurred, masked, or noise-injected** dynamically.
- Output images are optimized for **safe sharing** online.

### **Step 5 â€” Explainable Insights**
- Thunderbolt provides **visual analytics**:
  - A **circular danger gauge** for risk at a glance.
  - A **bar chart** showing how many sensitive features were detected.

## Future Enhancements

### **1. On-device AI**
- Process images entirely on-device for **maximum privacy**.

### **2. Generative Adversarial Masking**
- Use AI to create **context-preserving blurs** for masked areas.

### **3. Social Media Integration**
- Pre-scan images before sharing to ensure **no sensitive data leaks**.

### **4. Real-Time Video Privacy**  
- Extend detection and masking to live video streams.
